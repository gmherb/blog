Hi, I’m Greg, a DevOps engineer with over a decade of experience building, automating, and operating reliable infrastructure. My work spans Linux systems, cloud platforms, networking, CI/CD pipelines, and security, with strong focus on Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, Terragrunt, and Ansible.

I enjoy designing scalable architectures, improving developer workflows, and solving the kinds of distributed-systems problems that appear at scale. Much of my recent work involves Kubernetes, service networking, and cloud-native automation patterns.

This site is where I write about topics that interest me – Linux, cloud architecture, CI/CD, networking, security, and practical DevOps patterns from real-world environments. My goal is to share insights, break down complex topics, and document things I’ve learned along the way.

## Looking Ahead

My future aspirations are to work more closely with systems programming using languages such as Go, Zig, Rust, and C, while also exploring open source technologies such as Cilium and Istio (Ambient Mesh) to scale secure workloads in multi-cloud environments.
